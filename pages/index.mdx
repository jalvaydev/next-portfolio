Hi, I am a Junior Software Developer at Ideagen EHS. 

I'm a fullstack software developer and I'm looking to learn everything that I can about building web apps.

:rocket: Here's a list of some of the latest technologies I've been building with:
```
- NextJS
- SvelteKit
- Go
- Typescript
```

I'm looking for new and exciting opportunities, feel free to reach out to me if you would like to chat!
